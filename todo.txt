GCASH API comes from paymongo
- Initially, our decision was to integrate GCASH as the payment gateway, but as soon as we researched
more about it, GCash doesn't provide their own API. BUT Paymongo has an API that can collect GCASH payments.
It turns out that paymongo requires a business permit, and still wait for around 20 days to be verified.
